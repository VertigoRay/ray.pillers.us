It took me a while to get into the frame of mind to digest what occurred on Twitter.
A heavy twitter user might have an easy time tracking down the conversations and following the comments that are ordered by activity.
I, on the other hand, had a dificult time keeping up with it.
In case it is not clear, you will not find me on Twitter for personal reasons.
I did make the best out of the unfamiliar situation though.

The shorter quips enforced y Twitter did not allow me to fully flesh out a thought.
However, it did force me to think about a more terse version of the thought.
It really helped me express my opinion while saying less.
I found it frusterating to not be able to go into the amount of details as I normally would.
However, it is often said that long emails/messages are not read.
So this serves as good practice for learnign how to communicate more effectively with non-technical users.

Course instruction should definitely remain detailed, but this makes me believe that course communications should be kept as terse as possible for a more overall fruitful experience.

Adapting course instruction to Twitter is a mystery to me. 
I believe that most course discussions should be kept in private channels.
If I were to stretch, I would say that it might be a good place to ask for assistance on understanding the scope or instructions of an assignment.
Other than that, more private channels should be generally used for course discussions.
