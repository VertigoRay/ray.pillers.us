Perveen develops a theoretical framework for employing learning analytics in online education.
The framework considers the likelihood that online students are of multiple intelligences based on Howard Gardner’s 1983 theory of multiple intelligences.
I was not previously familiar with Gardner's theory, but I have been a long time a fane of frameworks that help to guide the user to a consistent resolution.
I feel like the article was mostly surrounded by constructivist notions, but I have a hard time putting a label on a framework that is supposed to adapt to the needs of the student.
To adapt, Perveen suggests using technology to monitor and analyze student behaviors.
I am interested in learning more about what, if anything, Perveen has researched along this line of thinking.

Smith and Abrams (2019) explored gamification and how it can accommodate the needs of all learners, including those who identify as disabled.
I believe that the term gamification is like the term cloud computing.
While it might seem like a new, trendy idea, it is just the re-marketing of an old idea.
Cloud computing has been around for decades under the guise of shared hosting.
Likewise, gamification reaks of behaviorism by another name (e.g.: punishments and rewards).
That's not to diminish the ideas of gamification.
I believe the re-marketing of behaviorism servers to get educators to pay attention to an old idea that has deserved more attention.

I am interested in how gamification and multiple intelligences can be correlated in a universal system that can be easily adapted to the needs of the student.
Especially, if the correlation is determined efficiently and consistently.
