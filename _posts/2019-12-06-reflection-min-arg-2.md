I felt that the core roles of teachers had not really changed in decades and weren't likely to change any time in the near future. That's not to say that methodologies won't change and the implementations of those methodolgies will always adapt to the needs of the students and the tools/technologies available.

I have had a ton of writer's block all semester. It was mostly spurred by my personal life getting in the way of my productivity. I've felt the lag in all aspects of my life, and I'm finally forcing myself to dig out of that hole. As I type this up with a sick feeling in my gut, I am left with a self-reminder that we all struggle. It's not the strugle that has defined me as a person, but the way I pull myself through it. I'm not the type of person to discuss my pains with others; after a lot of self-reflection, I have realized that it's my fear of appearing weak. I am weak. I have weaknesses like every person does. My strength is my perseverance and my ability to endure.

I don't believe it is dificult to spur critical thinking. After all, the activity itself spurred critical thinking. However, I do believe that challenges will arise as student needs are catered to. Not all people will be able to work through a project the same as others.

As a prepared for this argument, I realized how diverse the answer really is. I forced myself to take a side and realize that my future papers should focus more on the need to research a better understanding of the issue instead of finding an answer.
