Taking [Kudadoo's Test of Player Archetypes](https://uquiz.com/go111q) revealed me to be a *nemesis* (an agent of chaos).
I found that to be a bit off from the way I historically played the game.
I believe that several of the answers didn't match what I would actually do, so I chose the most intriguing option.
Maybe I would have been more intrigued by games by playing a more *maniacal* role.

The results for [my gamer motivation profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/profiles/gamerprofile/eazgBSBMPuXi8k32PqYgXY/) are action-oriented, social, and inquisitive.
I agree with the results of this profile.
My favorite games are [EverQuest](https://www.everquest.com) and [Halo](https://www.halowaypoint.com).
While they are definitely not in the same league as each other, they show diversity in what I play.
If I want a quick moment of amusement, I'll seek out a game in the *tower defense* genre; which is likely why [Orcs Must Die! 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/201790/Orcs_Must_Die_2/) appeals to me.
Most of my friends don't game with me anymore because I have taken a darker path to gaming.
I like to see how I can exploit flaws in the game to advance my toon in an automated way.
This often leads to me gaining significant levels in a short period of time, like overnight.
Most recently, I exploited [Diablo III](https://us.diablo3.com/en/) to gain levels in [T8+](https://d3resource.com/difficulties/) by exploiting infinite spawning minions that would get trapped and I could let my toon attack all night collecting items and experience while I slept.

The results for [my board games motivation profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/profiles/tabletop/eazgBSBMPuXi8k32PqYgXY/) are high conflict, relaxed, grounded, and gregarious.
I tend to just play board games with loved ones, even if they don't enjoy the same games as I do.
While not a *board game*, [Munchkin](https://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/) is one of my newer favorite games, but it tends to just have appeal in my circle of geek friends.
Which is fine, I always enjoy social support (Thomas, Parsons, & Whitcombe, 2019).
