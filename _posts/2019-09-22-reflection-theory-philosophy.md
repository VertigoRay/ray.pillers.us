The things we all go through on a daily and weekly cycle is sometimes daunting.
I wasn't born in Texas, but I got there as fast as I could.
About five years ago, I started a life in Ecuador and gained a wife an two lovely children.
I was fortunate enough to keep my position at [UNT](https://cas.unt.edu) while living abroad and supporting my family.
Some changes at UNT availed me of an opportunity for advancement, and after much deliberation, my wife and I agreed to move back to Texas with the family.
I would come first and return for them about six weeks later.
I came September 12, and planned to return for them October 25 to return with them on October 30th.
My children are both citizens and my wife's paperwork has been filed for immigration.
I purchased a car and was getting things arranged for their arrival.
Then, [all](https://www.facebook.com/100000542532311/posts/2895483227146400) [of](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2019/10/12/nota/7557179/contraloria-edificio-incendio) [this](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2946780368679039) [crazy](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2949426031747806) [stuff](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2949426031747806) [started](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2949598475063895/) [happening](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2949710538386022) [in](https://www.facebook.com/ecuavisa/photos/a.428619123080/10157862094053081) [Quito](https://www.facebook.com/ecuavisa/photos/a.428619123080/10157862032388081), in the same neighborhood and area of the city where I left my family.
The scariest thing right now is that the president has declared [*toque de queda*](https://www.facebook.com/elcomerciocom/photos/a.169485459741891/2947007735322969), which is a lot like [*The Purge*](https://youtu.be/K0LLaybEuzA) where no acts of violence will be prosecuted.
The reason for implementing this is for making sure all decent people stay inside so police can open fire on everyone in the street.
This might sound excessive, but the rioters are actively blocking access routes and preventing medical assistance, fire fighters, and other aid from reaching those in need.
Needless to say, my mind hasn't been on my studies lately.
However, my family is safe, and I cannot do anything to assist them right now.
So, putting off my work is only going to make things more dificult when I have to leave in a couple of weeks hoping to bring my family back with me.

The major change in my thought process has been to be more exact with my claims and supporting arguments.
I still struggle a lot with the exact writing styly though.
In the masters program, we were told that we are not experts and thus are not allowed to have an opinion on the matter, and my experiences do not matter for the same reason.
I found that to be odd and counterproductive to forming a unique perspective and opinion followed by well thought out argument for accompanying research.
However, in this program, my opinion appears to matter as long as I do not directly state that it is my opinion.
While I find it conflicting in some very obvious ways, I also find it comforting to know that my opinion and the source of those opinions (my experiences) actually do matter in the realm of higher level thinkers.

I feel like this may not cover the exact reflection topic that was posed, but this blog article served a very real need for me to release a lot of angst and stress going on in my life right now.
I cannot say that I'm feeling 100%, but I am looking at my school work again and moving forward.
