# Setting Up

1. Place all tokens on "GO".
2. Shuffle the deck of cards and place it near the board.
3. Decide who goes first; here is an idea for deciding:
   - First game: the person whose birthday is next chooses who goes first.
   - Next games: winner from previous game chooses who goes first.

# Game Play

Player roles both dice to decide either the shape or color they get to move to.
If you can move to the color of the shape you rolled, you get to go again.

For example, if you roll the color ([Red]) and a ([Triangle]), you can choose one of four possible options:

- Any RED shape.
- Any colored TRIANGLE.
- A RED TRIANGLE and draw a card.
- Lose your turn.

After the player moves, they say the color and shape of the place they are on.
If the player moved to a place matching both the color and the shape, they get to draw a card from the deck.

If the top of the card says "SECRET" at the top then the player can keep the card a secret and use it when it is convenient.
If the card does not say "SECRET" at the top then read the card out loud and do what the card says.

Proceed to the next player.

# Special Conditions

When the card deck runs out, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the card deck.
Players cannot keep more than 5 secret cards in their hand. Additional secret cards must be used as they are drawn.
Secret cards can be used at any time before a player lands on “END”. The moment a player lands on end, the game is over.
Only one player can occupy a tile at a time. If a second player lands on a tile, the first player is sent back to the “GO” tile.

# Scoring

There is no score. Only win and lose.

# Winning

Get your token to the "END" position first.

# Cards

Print out the indicated number of each card and paste them over a standard deck of cards. I’m counting 54 cards which includes the two jokers.
